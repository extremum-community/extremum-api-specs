# Internationalization

Multilingual set of strings allows to give the same text attribute in multiple languages. Ultimately, it can be given in all human languages known in this Universe ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘½


Wherever that's supported by respective object model, its text attribute may be given as a set of values in various locales. For specifying locales we use [IETF language tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) in the format defined by [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) (language-TERRITORY). For example, the American English is `en-US`.
